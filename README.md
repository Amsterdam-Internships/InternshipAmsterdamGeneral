# A Very Fancy Project Name

Explain in short what this repository is. Mind the target audience.
No need to go into too much technical details if you expect some people would just use it as end-users 
and don't care about the internals (so focus on what the code really *does*), not how.
The *_How it works_* section below would contain more technical details for curious people.

If applicable, you can also show an example of the final output.
